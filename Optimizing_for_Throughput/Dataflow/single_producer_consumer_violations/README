This is a common DATAFLOW issue, where the signal produced by the producer cannot be read by two consumers. This example shows both the problem and solution.

If you run the design directly, it will report:

ERROR: [HLS 200-779] Non-shared array 'tmp2' (dut_sol.cpp:53) failed dataflow checking: it can only have a single reader and a single writer.

Delete the comments in line 66 and 69, then the design can follow the single-producer-consumer paradigm.
